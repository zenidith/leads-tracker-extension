This is the Chrome extension that I created as part of the Scrimba Front End Developer Path. This app is useful for people in sales who might be browsing the web and find websites that they might want to contact later in order to pitch a sale to them. It could also be used for casual browsing to save websites that you might want to visit later, but don't want to put in your bookmarks. Each link is saved to a JSON file as localStorage. 

The Leads Tracker Chrome Extension is essentially a small html/css/js file which can be loaded as a web page, however after making the body of css to be smaller, I have loaded it up to chrome://extensions in developer mode.

After progressing throught the project, I did some extra commits and 'updated' the project in chrome://extensions. It can be downloaded and used in your own browswer too, if you wish!

Thank you so much to Scrimba for teaching me so much JavaScript and also showing me how straightforward it can be to build an extension and deploy it.
